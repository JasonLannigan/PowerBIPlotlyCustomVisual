# PowerBIPlotlyCustomVisual
A work in progress - PowerBI Plotly.js Custom Visual

The heatmap folder, is alomost identical to the code provided here.https://github.com/mohaali/PowerBIExamples/tree/master/plotly
The code compiles but currently will only display a blank tile when imported.

The ScatterPlot.pbiviz, is a working plotly (I assume js) working visual. It is from the same GitHub as above.

The other files show an attempt to try to migrate heatmap per this page. https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-visuals/docs/how-to-guide/migrating-to-powerbi-visuals-tools-3-0/
I was not able to upload the whole filesystem due to size of file however all of the code can be found here.
To replicate what I have already, simply create a new custom visual, using pbiviz.
